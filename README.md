# Lost-in-the-City
A short C++ game in which you guess the missing numbers to get home.

How to play:
============
* Guess the missing 3 numbers from your relative's phone number in order to get home.

Installation
============
* Due to it being a small C++ program, Windows Defender or any other anti-virus software may false-flag it. 
  You may have to disable your anti-virus software because of this.
  
* Download Lost in the City.exe and simply run it.

* I can assure you that my game has no viruses. I've even provided the source code of the executable to prove it.

I made this game as my first introduction to C++ using the Unreal Engine C++ course. 
I made it my own by providing my own story to the number game.
